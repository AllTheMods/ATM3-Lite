# All The Mods 3: Lite
With the increasing number of mods being added each day to the ATM3 modpack we are proud to announce the Lite version!

Intended to be a lighter version of the ATM3 pack in the same way that the ATM: Lite modpack for 1.10.2 was created, this modpack is designed not only to be resource friendly, but also add a good bit of balance to a modpack that has many mods than many would consider unbalanced.

Be assured that ongoing R&D and feedback from the player group will shape this pack and refine it over the short term.

The Intial Version has been designed to run on just 4GB of ram. In your profile options. Set the Memory Settings to a Minimum of 4096MB

Stay tuned for updates!

# Money / Donations
All The Mods has never been about making money, we just love playing games and making cool modpacks and contributing to the modded community. We understand that sometimes people like to "say thanks" so by request we have setup a Patreon with some perks and are considering expanding some ATM branded merchandise as well. Any money that we do get is used to "give back" such as hosting free public ATM servers.
